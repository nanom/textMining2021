# VizWiz-VQA disaggregation: A new set of visual question classes.


## Overview
In this work, through the exploration of different clustering strategies and morpho-syntactic analysis, a new set of eight main categories is presented and proposed, which are used to fine-tune a automatic classification model and in this way to be able to reanalyze the original set from a new perspective. It should be noted that this research sets aside the visual modality 'V', to focus on the 'QA' part of VQA, with the aim of disaggregate the majority classes, to facilitate the understanding of the nature of the questions, and the reasons for why many of these questions cannot be answered.
